# Distributions of continuous variables -----------------------------------

# P1 What type of visualization is appropriate for a single continuous variable?
# line graph, making it very clear its one var

# P2 What type of visualization is appropriate for a continuous variable across
# categorical variables?
# making clear which var is which, appropate scales for diff values

# P3 Use ggplot to visualize the distribution of sea surface salinity. Save your
# figure as “comm101p3.png”.

# P4 Use ggplot to visualize the distribution of sea surface salinity by ocean
# basin. Save your figure as “comm101p4.png”.

# P5 Interpret your figures from P3 and P4. What patterns do you notice?

# P6 Critique your figures from P3 and P4. What changes would highlight the
# patterns you interpreted in P5? You don’t need to write code for these
# changes, just describe them verbally.


# Relationships between continuous variables ------------------------------

# P7 Visualize the relationship between salinity and latitude by ocean basin.

# P8 Edit your figure from P7 to improve its interpretability in at least one of
# the following categories: visually differentiating the oceans, appropriateness
# of the labels, or use of negative space. Save this figure as “comm101p8.png”.
